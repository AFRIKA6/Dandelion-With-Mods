That's the current version because having it in the pack name makes you having to choose the pack everytime a new version comes out
Also Planetminecraft doesn't keep names properly anyway

Seriously though, I'm not saying "download on Mediafire to keep the name" just to get downloads or whatever. I just want you to see a proper name, lol




Also: "why versions?"

Why not? :^)

I mean, it's a bit ridiculous, but.............. I have to go, bye!
